--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Neural Networks:
   Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers.
   Main types include: Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN) for basic pattern recognition, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image processing, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for sequential data, and Transformers for natural language processing.

2. Convolutional Neural Networks:
   CNNs are specialized neural networks designed for processing grid-like data such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.
   Key components include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Trade-offs: excellent for image tasks but require large datasets and significant computational resources. Applications include image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

3. Recurrent Neural Networks:
   RNNs are neural networks designed for sequential data by maintaining hidden states that capture information about previous inputs.
   Variants include LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) which solve the vanishing gradient problem. Trade-offs: good for sequential data but slower to train than Transformers and can struggle with long-range dependencies.
